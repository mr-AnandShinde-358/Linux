<details>
<summary>click to expand!</summary>
Javascript is a single-threaded language. This means it has one call stack and one memory heap. As expected, it executes code in order and must finish executing a piece code before moving onto the next. This is what allows Javascript to be  non-blocking and use async operations.<br>
However, Javascript also has asynchronous behavior. This is what allows us to use setTimeout,AJAX, and promises. These fuctions are handled by the browser, not by Javascript itself. This is what allows Javascript to be non-blocking for main thread operations
